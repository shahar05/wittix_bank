# Wittix Bank

A simple three-layer banking application with clean separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### Handlers (HTTP Layer)
Handles incoming requests and responses:
- `handlers/account_handler.go` - Account endpoints
- `handlers/journal_handler.go` - Journal entry endpoints

### Services (Business Logic)
Contains the core business rules:
- `services/account_service.go` - Account operations
- `services/journal_service.go` - Journal entries and transactions

### Repository (Database)
Manages all data persistence:
- `repository/account_repo.go` - Account queries
- `repository/journal_repo.go` - Journal entry queries
- `repository/journal_lines_repo.go` - Debit/credit operations

### Models (Data Structures)
Defines the data:
- `models/models.go` - Core entities
- `models/request_models.go` - API request formats

## Testing

Unit tests are available in `test/unit_test.go`

**Why this structure?** Each layer has one job, making the code easy to test, update, and maintain.
